947|I was hesitating weather I should deal with their point of you|
924|history bears amplividence there is only one period in Indian history which is the period of freedom greatness and Glory|
651|new account has an UN question right to ex communicate any man who is guilty of breaking the rules of the cast|
893|on which Chatur varni I was based there is no doubt that in practice the relation with that of master and servants|
920|all these weapons were however denied to the masses in India by chaturvan|
883|even depends of one class upon another maze sometimes become allowable|
841|this is the reason why Rama killed Shambhu ka but this also shows that panel sanction is necessary for the maintenance of chaturya|
634|the Hindu's claim to be a very tolerant people in my opinion this is a mistake|
816|he had no recognition of The Infinite diversity of active tendencies and combination of tendencies of which an individual escapable|
977|while among non Hindu's there are many that hold them toget|
907|and it is that the low classes of Hindu's have been completely disabled for direct action on account of this ratchet system of chaturvanya|
837|some people seem to blame Rama because he want only and without reason killed shambooker|
647|if the group is tolerant and fair minded in dealing with such a|
772|all Reform consist in a change in the notions sentiment and mental attitude of the people towards men and things|
804|is this possible in this respect the ideal of Chatur varnia has as you will see close up in a day to the platonic ideal|
696|and why not|
968|Housefull and free is the interplay with other forms of associations|
787|old labels is aterly repellent and my whole being Rebels against it|
658|this is because he cannot do without society|
839|Ramraj based on Chaitra varnan as a king Rama was born to maintain other one|
949|that I must and that for two reasons firstly that are you to the problem cast is not nearly an attitude of neutrality|
986|there are plenty of these organic filaments which bind them tog|
656|he would like to have the society of its fellows on his terms|
632|this difference is undeltedly a difference due to cast|
812|in so far as it proceeds upon the possibility of an accurate classification of men into four distinct classes|
756|which is the severely practical affair and which demands a severely practical test|
799|how are you going to reduce the 4000 cars based on birth to the four varnas based on worth|
697|what objection can there be to fraternity|
864|sound just do it was a system of division of La|
909|Devra block man or Radha condemned to be blocked man and they never allowed to convert the AppLock share into swords|
636|this in difference of the Hindu's has become so much a part of their nature that a Hindu will quit makely tolerate and insult as well as a wrong|
727|a man's power is depended upon number one physical heredity|
869|why need the Shudra bother to take to education when there is the Brahmin to whom he can go when they occasion for reading a writing a Rises|
934|the Mahabharata and The Puranas are full of incidents of the stripe between the brahmins and the shatriyas|
640|the oppressed among the Hindus in differentism is the worst kind of disease that can infect people|
870|why need the shoes are worry to arm himself because there is the shatriya to protect him|
718|for slavery does not really mean a legalised form of subjection|
611|from where does the sick or the mahabudan derive is a strength which makes in brave and fearless|
866|that weather it was intended to lay down that he must not even interesting question|
760|to make it more attractive and to the sum opposition the protagonist of Chaturvedi great care to point out that their Chatur varni|
862|assuming that chaturvedias practicable I contain that it is the most wishes system|
876|to engage in economic enterprise and to be a fish and soldiers which are there respective functions|
714|the supporters of cast who would allow Liberty in the sense of a right to life lemon property|
687|it is not a case of a standing by virtue and not standing by voice|
838|but to blame Rama for killing Shambhu ka is to miss understand the whole situation|
931|judging from the past as a system of social organisation it has been tried and it has failed|
969|are the forces that separate groups and clauses more numerous than the forces that you night|
682|the capacity to appreciate merits and A Man Apart from his cast does not exist in a Hindu|
724|the objections to Equality maybe sound and one may have to admit that all men are not equal|
789|there are more solid Grounds on which I rely for my opposition to it|
821|consequently the utilisation of the qualities of individuals is incompatible with their stratification|
946|there appear to be others who are neither without you nor with you|
917|Social War has been raising between the strong and the week formal violently in Europe than It has ever been in India|
793|harmful and has turned out to be a measurable failure|
811|is also the criticism which must applied to the system of Chatur varni|
601|Hindu society being a collection of cars and each caste being a close Corporation there is no place for a convert|
753|the statement therefore must follow some rough and ready rule|
981|these are what call I'll calls organic filament|
726|but not the less one must accepted as the governing principle|
836|is proved by the story in the Ramayana of Rama killing shambook|
786|speech 16th|
659|a cart is ever ready to take advantage of the helplessness of a man and insist upon complete conformity to its code in letter and inspirit|
729|education accumulation of scientific knowledge everything which enables him to be more efficient than the Savage and finally number 3|
790|a close examination of this ideal has convinced me|
767|a soldier would be respected without his being designated the satriya|
763|it is an ideal to which I cannot Reconcile myself|
671|is responsibilities only to his cast|
834|Chatur varn cannot subsist by its own inherent goodness it must be enforced by law|
623|and Muhammad and to feel so assured and why is the Hindu field with such despair in the matter of help|
953|Sach Hindu site the case of Muslims|
683|there is appreciation of virtue but only when the man is a fellow cast man|
746|that is one reason why we cannot escape equality|
868|they say why should the sudra need trouble to acquire wealth when the three varnas are there to support him|
997|there may be cause among sex and Muhammad|
959|business combines political parties bands of keys and robbers|
995|that cost is not the same social significance among non Hindu as it has a mug Hindu's is clear|
958|and larger scope families friendship Co-operative Association|
773|it is common experience that certain names become associated with certain motions and sentiment|
619|the sick as well as the Muslim stands fearless|
1000|but with the Hindus the case is entirely different|
892|weather the relationship of Guardian and ward was the real underline conception|
689|have not Hindus committed prison against their country and the interest of their cast|
710|in the sense of a right to life and live|
684|the whole morality is as bad as tribal morality|
661|and if a conspiracy is a crime|
791|I just system of social organisation|
699|an ideal society should be mobile should be full of channels for conveying the change taking place in one part to other parts|
675|there is no Charity to the Nidhi suffering as such calls for no response|
643|12th speech|
911|on account of the Chatur they could receive no education|
694|what is your ideal society if you do not want cast is a questions that is bound to be asked of you|
608|cowardice which so painfully make him off from the Muhammad|
845|the supporters of chaturwar must give an assurance that they could successfully classified men|
716|in as much as it involved liberty to choose one's profession|
827|that the original for classes have now become 4000 cars|
610|the question naturally arises|
873|assuming this to be the correct view of the underlying conception of Chatur varni|
813|the chief criticism against Plato is that his idea of lumping of individuals into a few sharply mugged of class|
648|they will continue to assert and in the end succeed in converting their fellows|

670|cost is made public opinion impossible a Hindu's public is his cast|
785|is a Sneher|
970|what social significance in attached to this group life|
788|but I do not wish to rest my objection to chaturvaniya on near Grounds of sentiment|
944|speech 19|
704|this is fraternity which is only another name for democracy|
621|the presence of this Belief in the one helps him to hold out and the absence of it in the other make him to give a|
764|in the first place if under the chaturthvarnia of the Arya Samaj and individual is to take his place in the Hindu society according to his worth|
988|that all though there are cause among non Hindu|
844|there is why manusmriti prescribe such heavy sentences as cutting of the tongue or boring of molten lead in the years of the sudhara who decides or here's the weather|
722|any objection to Equality|
851|if they are to be classified according to their worth if the classification to be normal or real|
685|my cast Man right or wrong|
703|that must be social and osmosis|
705|democracy is not nearly a form of government|
620|and gives battle because he knows that though one he will not be alone|
805|to play to men fell By Nature into 3 classes|
902|any instance from anywhere of social and Justice must pale before it|

622|if you purse you this matter further and ask what is it that enables the sick|
914|baby came Reconcile to eternal servert you which they accepted as their in escapable Faith|
992|you do not proceed to ask him whether he is a Shiya or a Sunny shake or a Syed Khatik or a Punjabi|
842|not only panel sanction is necessary but penalty of that is necessary|
872|does interpreted it is a simple elevating and alluring theory|
989|as there are among Hindu's cause has not the same social significance for non Hindu's as it has for Hindus|
719|it means a state of society in which some men are forced to accept from other the purposes which control their conduct|
964|the question to be asked in determining whether a given society is an ideal society|
739|but selection under such circumstances would not be a selection of the able|
831|the system of shatrughnya must forpeethually face the problem of transgressive|
929|speech 18|
612|I am sure it is not due to relative superiority of physical strength died or drill|
835|that without panel sanction the ideal of Chaturvedi cannot be realised|
998|but the six and mohammedans will not outcast a sick or Muhammad if he broke his cast|
960|this is small groups are usually firmly well it tog|
613|it is due to the strength arising out of the feeling that all six will come to the rescue of a sick|
721|as on the caste system some persons are compared to carry on certain prescribed calling which are not of their choice|
755|the doctor of equality is glarely fallacious but taking all in all it is the only way or statement can proceed in politics|
650|they will Paris and the Reform will die out|
752|unico table treatment of men maybe humanity is not capable of a short man and classification|
877|contraryvise suppose that the discharge their functions but flood that duty to the Shudra or to one another|
688|case of standing or not standing by the cast|
975|and to cast among Hindu's on the other you will find that cost among non Hindu this fundamentally different from custom Hindus|
904|there have been social revolutions in other countries of the world|
888|but they are very perturned questions|
751|there is according to need or according to capacity|
605|11th speech|
828|there is a third difficulty in the way of the establishment of the system of Chatur|
915|it is true that even in Europe the strong is not strong from the exploitation may the spoilation of the week|
833|the whole system will breakdown being contrary to human nature|
965|is not weather there are groups in it because groups exist in all society|
899|he was prohibited from bearing arms list he should have the means to Rebel against their authority|
653|as a form of punishment there is really little to choose between X communication and death|
849|if the status of the women is to be the consequence of marriage|
918|yet the weak in Europe has had in his freedom of Military Service his physical weapon in suffering is political weapon and an education his moral weapon|
690|14th speech|
840|it was his duty therefore to kill Shambhu ka the Shudra who had trust his class and wanted to be a Brahmin|
824|nimali that it is not possible to pigeon men into holes|
940|the Bhagwat tells us very definitely that Krishna had taken avatar for one secret purpose and that was to an I hate the shutters|
963|this is true of every society in Europe as well as in Asia|
707|it is essentially and attitude of respect and reverence towards fellowman|
852|if it is to be nominal then it is useless and then the protagonist of vernier must admit that|
993|but you are not satisfied if a person tell you that he is a Hindu you feel bound to enquire into his cast|
910|they had no beyonds and therefore everyone who choose good and did sit upon them|
928|the period of defeat and Darkness is the period when Chatterjee flourish to the domination of the greater part of the people of the country|
747|but there is another reason why we must accept equality|
937|Naroli was the Brahmin an iso to the satriya and the shatriya and I saw to the brah|
627|among sex and Muslims|
655|it is true that man cannot get on with his fellows but it is also true that he cannot do without them|
901|there is no code of laws more in famous regarding social rights than the laws of Manu|
898|he was prohibited from acquiring knowledge lessed he should keep a study with regarding is interest|
657|if he cannot get it on his terms then he will be ready to have it on any terms even amount into complete surrender|
679|vah to Hindu Ek knowledge and follow the leadership of a great and good man|
818|all this is demonstrately wrong|
754|and that rough and ready rule is to treat old man alike not because they are like but because classification and sortment as impossible|
607|the idea underline Sangathan is to remove from the mind of The Hindu|
712|there is no objection to liberty and the sense of a right to property tools and materials as being necessary for earning a living to keep the body in due state of health|
808|he class them as defenders in war and guardians of internal peace|
948|but on further consideration I have come to the conclusion|
891|it must be admitted that it makes no provision to save God the interest of the word from the miss deeds of the guardian|
798|for this you must first break up the caste system in order to be able to establish the Warner system|
922|it is the system which dead ends paralysis and cripples the people from helpful activity|
770|which Arya Samaj is have not get to cons|
895|the Brahmin flutter the shtriya and both LED the Vaishya live and order to be able to live up on him|
885|education everyone must have means of Defence everyone must have that are the Paramount requirements of every man for his self preservation|
984|there is no integrating for someone the Hindu's to come to rack the disintegration caused by caste|
807|others reveal to him that over and above appetites they have a courageous disposition|
735|what would happen if men were treated and equili as they are in the first two respects|
777|based on birth and act according|
709|few object to Liberty in the sense of a right to free movement|
635|on Mary occasions they can be intolerant and if on summer tolerant that is because they are two week two oppose or two in different to oppose|
672|is loyalty is restricted only to his cast|
863|that the Brahmin should cultivate knowledge|
994|why because so essential is caused in the case of a Hindu that without knowing it you do not feel sure what sort of a beam he is|
830|one important requirement for successful working of chaturya is the maintenance of the penal system which could maintain it by its sanction|
884|but why make one person depend upon another in the matter of his vital needs|
803|free supposes that you can classify people into four definite classes|
606|the reasons which have made should be impossible for Hindus are also responsible for making Sangathan impossible|
775|our names which are associated with the definite and fixed nation in the mind of every Hindu|
982|there is the elastic Threads which help to bring the disintegrating elements toget|
820|not worthy of serious consideration|
720|this condition obtained even wear there is no slivery in the legal sense|
967|how numerous and varied are the interest which are consciously shared by the groups|
631|this explain why one Mohammad and is equal to a crowd of Hindus|
991|he does not tell you his cast all though he has one and you are satisfied with his answer when he tells you that he is a Muslim|
744|on the hand it can be urged that if it is good for the social body to get the most out of its members|
936|the brahmins or theshatriyas when the two met and the street|
692|there is nothing new in|
871|the theory of Chatur varnia understood in this sense maybe said to look up on the Shudra as the word and the three warners as his Guardians|
925|that is the period of the Maurya Empire at all other times the countries suffered from defeat and darkness|
916|but in Europe the strong have never contrived to make the week helpless against exploitation so shamelessly as were the case in India among the Hindus|
737|education family name business connections and inherited wealth|
691|I would not be surprised if some of you have grown very listening to this tire some tail of the side effects which caste has produc|
736|it is obvious that those and individuals also in whose favour there is|
644|the assertion by the individual of his own opinions and belief is on Independence and interest as over against group standards|
930|Chatur varni is not new it is as old as the Vedas that is the one of the reason why we are asked by the Arya Samaj just to consider its claims|
706|it is primarily a mode of associated living of conjoint communication experience|
615|The Hindu can derives no such a strength|
900|that this is how the shoes were treated by the Triveni cars is evidence by the laws of Manu|
618|developed stimularity and cow dice and in a fight surrender's or Run the way|
829|how are you going to maintain the system of chaturvania supposing it was established|
896|but the three agree to be done the Shudra|
628|there is a social cement which makes them boys|
858|but he would be a bold person who would say that it will a love women trees and women soldiers|
740|it would be the selection of the privile|
980|which exist in it|
906|there is only one answer which I can give|
750|and to treat each equitab|
686|my cast man good or bad|
776|so long as these names continue Hindus will continue to think of the Brahmin Kshatriya Vaishya and Shudra as hierarchical divisions of high and|
695|if you ask me my ideal would be a society based on liberty quality and fraternity|
701|consciously communicated and share|
700|in an ideal society that should be many interest|
741|the reason therefore which force is that in the third respect|
921|there cannot be a more the grading system of social organisation than the chaturvaniya|
881|who is to defend the liberty of the Shodh RAW and for the matter of that of the Brahmin and the Veshya when the person who is Robin him of it is the satriya|
662|I do not understand why such a new furious act as an attempt to ex communicate a person for daring to|
603|so long has cost remain|
961|and are open as exclusive ask us|
771|there is another objection to the continuous of these labels|
865|whether theory was in 10 to state that the Shudra need not|
748|a statement is concerned with last numbers of people|
633|so long as cost remains there will be no Sangathan and so long as there is no Sangathan The Hindu will remain week and week|
889|assuming the concept of Chatur varni|
761|is based not on birth but on Guna that is worth|
951|secondly they probably represent a considerable body of people|
666|cost in the hands of the orthodox has been a powerful weapon for persecuting the reforms and for killing all reform|
878|what is to happen to the Shudra if the three classes refused to support him on fear terms or combined to keep him down|
768|if European society Honours it soldiers and its servants without giving them permanent labels|
646|but whether the Reform will continue depends upon what is scope the group of fonts for such individual assertion|
990|aaj ka Mohammed Bin or a sick who he is he tells you that he is a Mohammedan or a sick as the case maybe|
725|but what of that equality maybe a friction|
955|inconsidering this question you must have the outside there in mind that no where is human society on single hole|
765|I do not understand why the Arya Samaj is insist upon labelling manners Brahmin|
933|how many times have the shatriyas and ilated the Brahmins|
880|who is trying to take advantage of a signals if the Brahmin|
978|the strength of a society depends upon the presence of points of contact|
614|then he isn't danger and that all mohammeddans will rush to save a Muslim if he is attend|
923|this is no exaggeration|
815|play to had no perception of the uniqueness of every individual office in commensurability with others of each individual forming a class of his own|
966|the questions to be asked in determining what is an ideal society are|
664|but as it|
625|the associated mode of life practice by the six and mohammedans produces fellow feeling|
717|but to object to the kind of Liberty is to perpetuate slavery|
826|that is impossible to accurately classified people into four definite classes is proved by the fact|
809|other show the capacity to grass the universal reason underline things|
886|how can the fact that is neighbour is educated and armed help a man who is uneducated and deser|
624|an assistant you will find that the reasons for this difference Lie and the difference in their associated mode of Living|
846|and they could induce modern society in the 20th century to referred the panel sanctions of manusmriti|
802|if they wish to make they establishment of chakravartin a success|
652|and when it is realised that ex communication involves a complete scissor of social intercourse it will be a great that|
956|it is always plural in the world of action the individual is one limit and suicide the other|
985|why among the non Hindu|
854|if it is real are the protagonist of the river prepared to follow the logical consequences of applying it to women|
957|between them lie all source of associated arrangements of lesser|
814|is a very superficial view of man and his powers|
817|to him they were types of faculties are powers in the individual constitution|
943|aur as a pattern on which the Hindu society should be rain model|
649|on the hand if the group is in tolerant and does not bother about the means it adopts to stifle such individual|
654|no wonder individual Hindu have not had the courage to asssert their Independence by breaking the barriers of cast|
673|what you has become cast written and morality has become cast bound|
996|if you take into consideration the consequences which follow breach of caste|
698|I cannot imagin|
783|is to make the reforms you tired|
850|what becomes of the underline principle of Chatur varnia namely that the status of a person should be based upon the worth of that person|
681|Abraham and will fall over leader only if he is a brah|
702|there should be very and free points of contact with other modes of association|
819|modern science has shown that lumping together of individuals into a few sharply mugged of classes as a superficial view of|
890|that the relationship between the different classes if that of ward and Guardian in the real conception underline the vernier|
976|first the toys which consciously make the Hindu's hold together are non exist|
693|I will there for done to the constructive side of the problem|
972|it is in the light of these questions that one must decide|
641|why is the Hindu so in different in my opinion|
945|I have dealt with those who are without you and whose hostility to your ideal is quite open|
908|they could not be aarms and without arms they could not Rebel|
999|indeed the very idea of excommunication is foreign to the six and the Muhammad|
974|if we apply these considerations to cast among Mohammad and 6 and Christians on the one hand|
762|at the outside I must confess that not with standing the word basis of this Chatur var|
853|the system does not apply to women|
723|this is obviously been the most contentious part of the slogan of the French Revolution|
629|among Hindu's there is no such cement and one Hindu does not regard another Hindu as his bhai|
604|Hindu religion cannot be made a missionary religion and Shuddhi will be both of poly and a futility|
769|why should Hindu society find it difficult to do so in a question|
728|number to social inheritance or an Diamond at the form of parental care|
637|you see among them to use the words of Morris|
855|they must be prepared to have women trees and women soldiers|
867|the defenders Of chaturya give it the first meaning|
822|by classes since the qualities of individuals are so variable|
954|6 and Christians and find comfort in the fat that they to have cause among them|
780|if new notions are to be inculcated in the minds of the people|
766|a learned it man would be honoured without his being label the Brahmin|
676|there is Charity but it begins with the cost and ends with the cast|
894|the three classes Brahmin kshatriyas and vessels all though not very happy and their mutual relationship manage to work by compromise|
950|but is an attitude of armed neutrality|
742|we should treat men unequally demands that in the first to respect|
792|impractica|
861|speech 17th|
932|how many times have the brahmins and ilated the seed of the satriya|
730|on is on efforts|
860|given these difficulties I think no one accept a congenital idiot could hope and believe in a successful regeneration of the chaturma|
758|but there is a set of reformers who hold out at different ideal they go by the name of the Arya Samaj|
823|Chatur varnya must fail for the very reason for which plateaus Republic must fail|
800|this is the first difficulty with the protagonist of the Other must grape|
952|of these there is one set which finds nothing Peculiar not Idiots in the caste system of the Hindus|
782|you continue the old name|
678|there is sympathy but not for men of other caste|
731|in all these three respects Minar undoubtedly unequal but the question is shall we treat them as an equal because they are unequal|
926|but the Maurya period was a period when Chaturvedi was completely and highlighted|
734|it may be desirable to give as much incentive as possible to the full development of everyone's powers|
669|cost has killed public spirit cast has destroyed the sense of public charity|
778|The Hindu Muslim made to UN learn all this|
639|with Hindu Gods all for bearing it is not difficult to imagine the pretible condition of the wrong and|
713|why not allow liberty to benefit by an effective and Competent use of a person's powers|
665|even love gives each cast and attorney to regulate its membership and punish the centres with X communication|
897|he was not allowed to acquire wealth list he should be independent of the three Verna|
