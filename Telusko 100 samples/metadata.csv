86|We got the output but here's a trick what if I what if I have both in the string example let's say we have print I want to say Naveen's laptop|
75|aapse you can see it works also got Naveen as a Manju there okay that works now if you say difference between Naveen the earlier command here if you compare this one with this one See the output|
96|let let me know the comment section I will work or not and then we can continue what I will do it I will print something I would say see colon / I have a habit|
54|you know what is string means it's a combination of characters example my name Naveen|
89|Python hey Python can you just skip that special meaning of that single coat and the way you do that is by giving us slash so when you say Back slash it will make sure that|
37|nowadays we can do here what if I want to find a power of audio we can say exponent you select say if you have to|
41|double star symbol simply means power of so when is the 2 days 2 3 so this|
76|one the single code is getting printed as well but in the second one it is only printing my name and that looks beautiful|
94|10 into in single coat you can say Naveen and Centre you can see regard Naveen 10 times yeah so what is fun actually you know you can you can play with|
10|so you understand English so what you will do if you will learn a programming language let's say Python in this case and then you will write a python code which will get|
13|as we discussed each one of the easiest language right so what I will do it I will say to plus three this is the simplest you can do on Python I Vil se|
80|example you can say print and double coats you can say Naveen laptop Now since starting and ending is done with the help of double coach he don't have to|
49|you can see me got one which is a remainder so when is the 10 model 3 you will get a reminder which is|
74|you have a print you normally give this Round Back head to pass any parameter lets ife u want Tu past something to the function you can do it here in this case I want to pass my own names I am saying print Naveen|
34|record 14 which is 8 + 6 but what if I want to say A + 2 which is 10 and den three so|
6|so what you did to use a language which will which both will understand and of course do we so we all knowing this language but computer Vil not understand|
90|it will ignore this special meaning of that single quotes when I Centre it works notice the decision talking about|
47|you got 3 that's why but what if I want to remainder part of it|
99|no slush and has a special meaning in Python what is that special meaning and meaning is it means new lines|
50|okay this works yeah now you know all the oppit US right now what does|
60|Sab use my name first I will|
30|which is invalid Syntax and that's why you need to follow the grammar as well soon as when you learn a language you need to follow grammars in the|
45|giving two numbers which is 10 / 2 in this case no|
70|not a function|
11|what is into binary format which are committed understand so if you say hey computer do something for me so let's go with us very simple stuff here let's I want to add two numbers so|
3|and then we have Google assistant on Android phones I know you can ask them to do things for you example you want to set n alarm u can u no De Vil DU ITE for u but|
85|these string part should be different from the path which are insights inside the heart double coats then outside which be using single coat write that next sense write so|
84|this this is my first string what about this laptop now in that case we will be using single code so single coat and end with single code so you have|
18|you can see when we say 2 + 3 record 5 9 - 8 which is one so when you subtract two numbers with we are in that number right and|
14|this working what else what about subtraction you know we we love mathematics right so let's apply all the Corporation|
72|example in print which is inbuild it has it in task which it will do you just say to call it or can we define our own functions yes we can so print is a|
36|yes this also work so when you multiply so if you give a bracket it will be solved first okay this school right|
65|abhi Court Naveen|
68|providing|
38|5 raise to 6 how can I do that I will say to I want to find cube of 2 Sin that|
39|I can say to into 2 into 2 I we can do that but then what if you have to tell you cannot simply type|
15|let's try 9 - 8 which are you want I will be got wants to yes subtraction also works OK what else we can use can use multiplication let's|
2|SMS if you want to send an email you don't have to do that your computer will do it for you if you instructed example nowadays we have this amazing thing U no vi have Siri on iPhone|
61|and Naveen|
43|now we know how to add two numbers how to subtract to numbers and then multiplication division of flow division|
79|single code that's for that that's why it was starts so you cannot simply have single coat anywhere right so how do you solve this problem to solve this problem we have to solutions the first one is|
71|functions which we can use and one the function is print now what print means what function menses it is a set of task which you will|
66|prin|
52|types one is the integer type which we have done here and then|
46|it was give you three right but then we also have a reminder|
69|functions|
77|point let's say nothing|
35|8 + 2 which is in the packets and then into|
42|hat tricks 3 and you can see the god it so that's how you have to find you have to do this all this operation|
95|can do some experiment that amazing what if I want to print this one you tell me okay you get you try to guess it will it work or not just pause d video|
12|computer 2 plus 3 computer will say okay 5 but and how you talk to computer in this case so we are using Python and then we have interpreter insight in p|
33|now which one will be done first of course the multiplication part right but then what if you want to do it on its try this first|
97|rocks / Naveen suppose the video think about it and let's see what output Dev giving let's try and try|
